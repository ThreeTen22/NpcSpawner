As a major fan of Create-A-Friend,  I always liked the idea of customizing the npcs which you interact with.  My biggest concern was the fact that I couldn't really get the exact npc that I wanted.  Whether its visuals or personality, it was just not quite right.

So after doing some brute force testing on the "parameter" variable in the /spawnnpc command, I figured out how to reverse engineer the chargen system.  So now you can create NPCs in the same general manner as creating a new character.

Woo!

This is still very much a WIP,  but any problems it may have is self-contained, as no actual spawning is done until you press accept.

I modeled the spawn system similar to Create-a-Friend,  since I am pretty new to modding starbound and used it as a jumping point,  but there are some definitive differences.


What you currently can do:

-Customize and spawn NPCs of any playable species, 
(or more technically,  any species which I can find parsing popular config files, and whose .species file is at the top level of the species sub-folder.  If your specific NPC cannot be found, you can manually input the name of it in the "override' textbox)

-Added a "random" slider of my own to create random NPCs, similar to create-a-friend,  increase the range from 100 to 2,000


What's in the works:
-NPC inventory management
