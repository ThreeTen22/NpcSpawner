  "description" : "Want to be able to spawn in and customize npcs well beyond even what the chargen gives you?\r\nWant to just find that one bloody human npc with the short green hair?\r\nWell brother(or sister!), we at N.P.C. Inc. have got good news for you!\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroducing:\r\n\r\n[h1]NpcSpawner+[\/h1]\r\n\r\n(tldr description: \"If the vanilla chargen and Create-A-Friend had a baby, this would be it\" - random comment)\r\n\r\n\r\n[strike]AUTHORS NOTE:\r\n\r\nI have stopped actively supporting this mod as I have stopped playing starbound.  That being said as of writing this (feb 2018) there are no major gamebreaking issues.  If anyone wants to extend this mod and add it to steam they are welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDHEMKFC[\/strike]\r\n\r\nI Lied:\r\n1.2 Preview - ETA (sometime in may):\r\n-Fixed crash error caused by a certain mod that just straight up removes a core npc table. \r\n\r\n-Proactive Item Slots-\r\nIf something doesn't go in that slot, it will prevent you from putting it in there. Should allow for a more consistant experience.\r\n\r\n-Export Cards-\r\nThe export button will now also create a vanllla friendly \"punch card\" that you can keep in your inventory. This card will hold all necessary information about the npc you have created. You can then easily trade and use this data with other Spawner stations by inserting the card into the \"import\" item slot.\r\n\r\n-Crewmember Addon-\r\nThis small addon will ensure that the weapons and armor you give crewmembers will stay on them. This is a multiplayer friendly solution, and will not cause permanent modifications to your crewmembers if you decide to remove the addon,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe go into lots of detail about the inner workings of this valuable asset via in-game tabs, so instead here are some highlights:\r\n\r\n[b]-Choose from 20,000 different randomly generated NPCs-[\/b]\r\n--customize those NPCs to an extent never seen before! [i](queue outer space echoes)[\/i]\r\n\r\n[b]-All playable species should be supported, modded or not-[\/b]\r\n--If it's playable, it's customizable. If it's not playable, with a few in-game keystrokes it can become customizable.\r\n\r\n[h1]-NpcTypes-[\/h1]\r\n\r\nWhen choosing an NPC, their npctype is incredibly important. We have added most of the vanilla npctypes for your convenience and it has been designed to handle any npctype, modded or not. If the npctype you want isn't found on the list you will be able to add these modded npctypes with a few keystrokes. We guarantee it or your money back! [i]Certain restrictions apply, call our 24-7 customer service for more details.[\/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]-Visual-[\/h1]\r\n\r\nWant to color an apex's beard a little differently than the rest of his\/her body? Want the glow of a novakid's hair to be a tad more blue? No problem. You will be able to safely color each (customizable) part separately. On top of that, body parts can have hue and saturation applied to it. Avians can finally have something other than white faces, and humans can be as blue or as green as you see fit.\r\n\r\n[h1]-Armor \/ Weapon modifications-[\/h1] \r\n\r\nWant a guard that uses a sword\/shield and a capture pod? How about creating a worthy foe duel-wielding grenade launchers?\r\n\r\nAll NPCs with combat behavior will use whatever weapons you give them. More importantly, if the weapons\/armors use vanilla objects as a base, they will work on vanilla multiplayer servers.\r\n\r\n[h1]-Customize Crewmembers-[\/h1] \r\n\r\n--You can use this tool to modify some of the weapons which your crewmembers will use. That means soldiers can duel wield pistols, and outlaws can use a sword and shield!\r\n\r\n(currently only vanilla warriors (\"crewmember\") and outlaws (\"crewmemberoutlaw\") can use custom weapons  If you use FU then any FU crewmember can use custom weapons.  No crewmember can use custom armors.  This is due to vanilla limitations.  I am working on an extension to prevent this, but it unfortunately cannot stick to the 100% vanilla friendly compatibility that this mod aims for.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]-Vanilla Multiplayer Server Support-[\/h1]\r\n\r\n--This mod provides an export option that allows you to spawn in a vanilla \"spawner\" item. All you will need to do is just copy and paste the provided command line from your starbound.log file.\r\nWe at NPC Inc. raise our npcs on a script-free diet and can function perfectly fine without the assistance of refresh scripts that other universes might not have.\r\n\r\n[b]Reminder:[\/b] Non Cultivator-blessed species and unfamilar npctypes might not work in universes that do not support them.  \r\n(If you use a custom species, or use an npctype provided by a mod like FU and then try to spawn\/use them in a vanilla server,  you are going to have a bad time.)\r\n\r\n[h1]-Stat modifications-[\/h1]\r\n\r\n--There are a few (and growing) amount of stat modification commands you can use to make your npc behave a certain way. These commands are for the more advanced users, and are not required whatsoever to make any of the above work.\r\n\r\n[h1]-In-Game data visualization-[\/h1]\r\n\r\n--Ever wanted to know what makes an npc tick? This mod hosts a number of debug features that allow you to view the inner workings of an npc. No more guessing if a variable or behavior is being overwritten, you can actually see what the game is reading.\r\n\r\n[h1]How To Craft:[\/h1]\r\n[olist]\r\n\t[*]Get a T3 Inventors Table\r\n\t[*]Craft an Employer's Station\r\n\t[*]Craft a Panel Version (looks similar to a deed), or Floor Version (looks like a floor teleporter)\r\n[\/olist]\r\n\r\n[h1]How To Use:[\/h1]\r\n[olist]\r\n\t[*]Place the spawner in the location you want your npc to be.  Ex, a checkout counter for a merchant, or a guardpost for a guard\r\n\t[*]Interact with the spawner to bring up the interface\r\n\t[*]For best results, we recommend reading the information provided in-game via the 'info' tab in each category.\r\n\t[*]When finished customizing your npc, press the activate button to spawn it in.\r\n[\/olist]\r\n\r\n[h1]How To Manage:[\/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n\t[*]Similar to a deed, the npc is initially bound to the spawner that created it. If the spawner breaks, the npc will be [strike]vaporized[\/strike] teleported home. (See the detach tab in-game for more information on finalizing npcs)\r\n\t[*]While bound to a spawner, you are able to modify the npc as many times as you wish, just remember to press the activate button after any change.\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[\/b]  Similar to a deed, a pseudo-random npc will immediately spawn when first placing the spawner object.  This npc will be replaced by the one you create\r\n\r\n[h1]Q&A[\/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]1. I spawned in an npc and it disappears either after it warps in, or after I interact with it.  Whats going on?[\/b]\r\n-There is an incompatibility between the species and the npctype. Changing the species to one that the npctype was meant for or switching to a more universal npctype will fix this.\r\n\r\n[b]2. I put down a panel and it spawned a hostile enemy. Help![\/b]\r\n... N.P.C. Inc, is legally oblidged to warn you that the placeholder npc might  [strike] be pissed off after suddenly  being ripped through spacetime without prior warning[\/strike] experience some adverse side affects of our teleportation method which includes hyper levels of aggression. \r\n\r\n[h1]Version 1.1.6 Hotfix[\/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fixed small error when going to a new planet and trying to access the npctype tab for the first time.\r\n[*]Note:  This mod does not check for SB 1.3 compatibility in regards to species,  therefore I highly suggest checking to see if the species has been updated before trying to spawn one in!\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Version 1.1.5[\/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fixed gender problem when detaching npc.  Should work just fine.\r\n[*]1.3 compatibility\r\n[*]Note:  Cannot permanently add species and npctypes in-game anymore.  This is due to vanilla changes in the API.  You can still add species and npctypes temporarily, they will disappear after closing the GUI.\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods:\r\n[url=http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=908048884]Hungry Hungry Tonauac![\/url]",
