  "description" : "Ever get sick and tired of just not getting the npc you want? \nWant to be able to customize npcs of every sort well beyond even what the chargen gives you?\n\nWant to just find that one bloody human npc with the short green hair?\n\nWell brother(or sister!), we at N.P.C. Inc. have got good news for you!\n\nIntroducing:\n\nNpcSpawner+\n\nWe go into lots of detail  about the inner workings of this valuable asset via in-game tabs, so instead here is some highlights:\n-Choose from 20,000 different randomly generated npcs.\n-customize those npcs to an extent never seen before! (*queue outer space echoing):\n\n-Inherent support of all playable species.\n--If its playable, its customizable. If its not playable, with a few in-game keystrokes it can become customizable.\n\n-NpcTypes.  When chosing an npc, their npctype is incredibly important. We have added most of the npctypes provided by vanilla.  However, it has been designed to handle any npctype, modded or not.  With a few keystrokes you will be able to add these modded npctypes.  We garuntee it or your money back *certain restrictions apply, call our 24-7 customer service for more details.\n\n-Visual-\nWant to color an apex's beard a little differently than the rest of his/her body?  Want the glow of a novakid's hair to be a tad more blue?  No problem.  You will be able to safely color each (customizable) part separately.  On top of that, each body part can have hue and saturation applied to it.  Avians can finally have something other than white faces, and humans can be as blue or as green as you see fit.\n\n\n-Armor / Weapon modifications.  This is the bread and butter.  Want a guard that uses a sword/shield and a capture pod?  How about a crewmember with a sniper rifle or a flamethrower?\n--All (aggressive) npcs will use whatever weapons you give them.  More importantly,  if the weapons/armors are not completely modded,these npcs can be safely transferred to vanilla multiplayer servers.  These npcs do not rely on any modded scripts whatsoever.\n\n--Custom crewmembers\n--This tool will effectively override whatever weapons crew members initially get with the ones you provide.  That means soldiers can have a sword a shield,  and janitors can end up with a sniper rifle.  This tool, paired with any other outfit management mod will allow for some very unique and useful crewmembers!\n\n\n-Stat modifications\n--There are a few (and growing) amount of stat modification commands you can use to make your npc behave a certain way.  These commands are for the more advanced users, and are not required whatsoever to make any of the above work.\n\n\n-In-Game data visualisation\n--Ever wanted to know what makes an npc tick?  This mod hosts a number of debug features that allow you to view the inner workings of an npc .  No more guessing if a variable or behavior is being overrwritten, you can actually see what the game is reading.\n\n-Vanilla server support\n--This mod provides an export option that allows you to spawn in a vanilla \"spawner\" item.  All you will need to do is just copy and paste the provided command line from your starbound.log file.\n\n\nNote: We here at N.P.C. Inc. Have now been up well past our bedtimes, and are deeply apologetic about any spelling and grammer mistakes you may have read.\n\n\n\n(R.P.ing  aside, I am super excited about this mod and hope you all find it useful.  I have tried my best at QAing this, but this is its first public release and I am sure there will be something.  I have designed this mod to be very self-contained, so 99% of glitches and hickups will be clientside/visual and can be reset by just reopening the pane window.\n\n-Some known bugs:\n---Switching hair/body colors while under a script heavy enviroment may \"lock up\".  That is, the color will never change despite selecting different options.  Scrolling to the top and selecting the \"remove override\" option will fix this.\n\n---Color mismatch:\n---When selecting a color for a body/hair..etc.  part, the  displayed color may be a little off than how it is shown on the npc.  This is due to the nature of directives. There are between 4-12 replaced colors per option, and I can only display one, so I try to pick something that would best represent the selection.\n\n\nPlease let me know of any other bugs, I will do what I can to squash them.\nEnjoy!)",
