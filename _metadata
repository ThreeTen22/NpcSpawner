  "description" : "Want to be able to spawn in and customize npcs well beyond even what the chargen gives you?\nWant to just find that one bloody human npc with the short green hair?\nWell brother(or sister!), we at N.P.C. Inc. have got good news for you!\n\nIntroducing:\n\n[h1]NpcSpawner+[/h1]\n\n(tldr description: \"If the vanilla chargen and Create-A-Friend had a baby, this would be it\" - random comment)\n\n[h1]1.2.1 Has Been Released! See Below for more details[/h1]\n\nWe go into lots of detail about the inner workings of this valuable asset via in-game tabs, so instead here are some highlights:\n\n[b]-Choose from 20,000 different randomly generated NPCs-[/b]\n--customize those NPCs to an extent never seen before! [i](queue outer space echoes)[/i]\n\n[b]-All playable species should be supported, modded or not-[/b]\n--If it's playable, it's customizable. If it's not playable, with a few in-game keystrokes it can become customizable.\n\n[h1]-NpcTypes-[/h1]\n\nWhen choosing an NPC, their npctype is incredibly important. We have added most of the vanilla npctypes for your convenience and it has been designed to handle any npctype, modded or not. If the npctype you want isn't found on the list you will be able to add these modded npctypes with a few keystrokes. We guarantee it or your money back! [i]Certain restrictions apply, call our 24-7 customer service for more details.[/i]\n\n[h1]-Visual-[/h1]\n\nWant to color an apex's beard a little differently than the rest of his/her body? Want the glow of a novakid's hair to be a tad more blue? No problem. You will be able to safely color each (customizable) part separately. On top of that, body parts can have hue and saturation applied to it. Avians can finally have something other than white faces, and humans can be as blue or as green as you see fit.\n\n[h1]-Armor / Weapon modifications-[/h1] \n\nWant a guard that uses a sword/shield and a capture pod? How about creating a worthy foe with a grenade launcher and a warhammer?  All NPCs with combat behavior will use weapons you give them.  Want the npc to stick to ranged?  Provide it with only a ranged weapon.  Want to have a spartan warrior?  Give it a spear + 1h pistol and a shield!  Want to have a pokemon master?  Give it two capturepods.\n\n[h1]-Customize Crewmembers-[/h1] \n\n--You can use this tool to modify some of the weapons which your crewmembers will use.\n(currently only vanilla warriors (\"crewmember\") and outlaws (\"crewmemberoutlaw\") can use custom weapons  If you use FU then any FU crewmember can use custom weapons.  No crewmember can use custom armors.  This is due to vanilla limitations.  I am working on an extension to prevent this, but it unfortunately cannot stick to the 100% vanilla friendly compatibility that this mod aims for.)  (subject to change when the addon comes out)\n\n[h1]-Vanilla Multiplayer Server Support-[/h1]\n\n--This mod provides an export option that will automatically create a /spawnnpc command for you to use whever you wish!  All you will need to do is just copy and paste the provided command line from your starbound.log file.\nWe at NPC Inc. raise our npcs on a script-free diet and can function perfectly fine without the assistance of refresh scripts that other universes might not have.  Additionally, you can store your npc's with our state-of-the-art trading card technology.  Make saves and backups of your npcs and bring them back to life by dropping them into the import slot!\n\n[b]Reminder:[/b] Non Cultivator-blessed species and unfamilar npctypes might not work in universes that do not support them.  \n(If you use a custom species, or use an npctype provided by a mod like FU and then try to spawn/use them in a vanilla server,  you are going to have a bad time.)\n\n[h1]-Stat modifications-[/h1]\n--There are a few (and growing) amount of stat modification commands you can use to make your npc behave a certain way. These commands are for the more advanced users, and are not required whatsoever to make any of the above work.\n\n[h1]How To Craft:[/h1]\n[olist]\n\t[*]Get a T3 Inventors Table\n\t[*]Craft an Employer's Station\n\t[*]Craft a Panel Version (looks similar to a deed), or Floor Version (looks like a floor teleporter), or Cloaked Version (its [i]nearly[/i] invisible)\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]How To Use:[/h1]\n[olist]\n\t[*]Place the spawner in the location you want your npc to be.  Ex, a checkout counter for a merchant, or a guardpost for a guard\n\t[*]Interact with the spawner to bring up the interface\n\t[*]For best results, we recommend reading the information provided in-game via the 'info' tab in each category.\n\t[*]When finished customizing your npc, press the activate button to spawn it in.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]How To Manage:[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*]When finished, the npc you created will spawn and be managed by the spawner object, similar to how a deed manages a tenant.\n\t[*]While bound to a spawner, you are able to modify the npc as many times as you wish, just remember to press the activate button after any change.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Q&A[/h1]\n\n[b]1. I spawned in an npc and it disappears/explodes either after it warps in, or after I interact with it.  Whats going on?[/b]\n-There is an incompatibility between the species and the npctype. Changing the species to one that the npctype was meant for or switching to a more universal npctype will fix this.\n\n[h1]1.2.1 Changes And You! (Not Broken Edition)[/h1]\n\n[b]New Line of Spawners[/b]\nRather than forcing everyone to upgrade at once, the new line of Npc Maker products *the 3100 series* will be available to purchase as separate objects.  This will allow you to port over your colonies at your pace.\n\n[b]New - Npc Maker 3100: Cloaked Edition[/b]\nThe miracles of modern technology has brought all the power of the traditional spawners down to the size of a near-invisible 1x1 dot. This object should be useful for those that like their wall space.\n\n[b]Spawning Changes[/b]\n[list]\n\t[*]Spawner objects will now initially spawn only villager variants.  This is to prevent any accidental damages from angry NPCs.\n[/list]\n\n[b]ItemSlot Changes[/b]\n[list]\n\t[*]Items provided by an NpcType, or by an imported/saved NPC, will now be visible as \"ghost items\".  These can be viewable, but cannot be taken.\n\t[*]These itemSlots have two states.  Active and Inactive.  To prevent an itemSlot from affecting your Npc, click the itemSlot with an empty cursor.  The itemSlot will be emptied, and will appear shaded.  To reactivate the itemSlot, click it again or add an item from your inventory.\n\t[*]The active/inactive state of an itemslot will be reset when selecting a new npcType.\n\t[*]Right-click the itemslot to completely reset the itemSlot.  This will force it to use whatever item may be provided by the NpcType or it will remain empty.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Override Changes [/b]\n[list]\n\t[*](3100 series only) Added new override command \"set questparticipation [[true | false]]\".  Setting this value to false will prevent any npc from participating in quests.  Useful for those who do not want to see exclamation marks every 5 minutes.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Npc Cards[/b]\n[list]\n\t[*]Click the Export slot on the top-right corner of the pane to export your NPC as an item.  You can then store / trade / use these cards with other players and spawners.\n\t[*]The item is a modification of a vanilla item and therefore can be safely traded in a vanilla server. \n\t[*][i]Remember though, the actual visuals will depend on the visual mods each player has...particularly when dealing with items that have been modded in different ways.[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bug Fixes[/b]\n[list]\n\t[*]Fixed rare but gamebreaking bug that bricked players from their worlds\n\t[*]Fixed itemSlot bug that prevented users from adding certain weapons\n\t[*]Users will be notified if they cannot view a spawner pane, due to not having the appropriate race/npctype mods\n\t[*]Naked crewmember's shouldn't be a thing anymore...unless you want it that way.\n\t[*]Added some checks to prevent an error brought about by another mod\n\t[*]Vastly stabilized the pane menu.  It should load and respond much more quickly.\n\t[*]Fixed the broken green text when pressing enter after changing your npc name or using override functions\n[/list]\nStay tuned for the upcoming addons relating to tenants and crewmembers!\n\nCheck out my other mods:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=908048884]Hungry Hungry Tonauac![/url]",
